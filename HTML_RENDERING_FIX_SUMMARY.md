# HTML Rendering Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The profile tab was displaying raw HTML text instead of properly rendered content. This was caused by JavaScript code in the `content_section` function that wasn't executing properly in Streamlit's environment.

## Root Cause
- The `content_section` function in `utils/components.py` (lines 473-550) used inline JavaScript with `<script>` tags
- Streamlit doesn't execute inline JavaScript properly in most cases
- This caused HTML content with JavaScript to be displayed as raw text instead of being rendered
- The function was used extensively throughout the profile tab for collapsible content sections

## Solution Applied
Replaced the JavaScript-based collapsible functionality with Streamlit's native `st.expander` component:

### Before (Problematic):
```python
def content_section(title, content, collapsed=True, icon=None, border_color=None):
    # Generated unique IDs, HTML with onclick handlers, and <script> tags
    # Used JavaScript function toggleSection() to handle expand/collapse
    st.markdown(header_html + content_html + script, unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
def content_section(title, content, collapsed=True, icon=None, border_color=None):
    # Uses Streamlit's native st.expander component
    with st.expander(full_title, expanded=not collapsed):
        # Renders content with proper HTML styling
        st.markdown(content, unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

## Benefits of the Fix
1. **Native Streamlit Component**: Uses `st.expander` which is fully supported and reliable
2. **No JavaScript Dependencies**: Eliminates the need for inline JavaScript that doesn't work in Streamlit
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Ensures collapsible sections work consistently across all browsers and devices
4. **Maintains Functionality**: Preserves all original features (icons, border colors, expanded/collapsed states)
5. **Better User Experience**: Content renders properly instead of showing raw HTML text

## Files Modified
- `utils/components.py`: Updated `content_section` function (lines 473-495)

## Impact
This fix affects all usage of `content_section` throughout the application, including:
- Profile tab (`views/profile.py`) - 5 instances
- Neuroleader Explorer (`views/neuroleader_explorer.py`) - 12 instances

## Testing Recommendations
1. Open the profile tab and verify that content sections display properly
2. Check that expandable sections work correctly (can be opened/closed)
3. Verify that icons and border colors still display properly
4. Test on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness is maintained

## Additional Notes
- Other files with JavaScript (`layout.py`, `notifications.py`, etc.) were examined but don't appear to cause the same issue
- The `layout.py` file handles JavaScript properly by commenting it out and using fallback mechanisms
- No syntax errors were introduced by the changes
